cmocean colormaps for Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)

These colormaps are also available through [cpt-city](http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/cmocean/index.html).

Bring beautiful oceanography colormaps into your research. There is [documentation](http://matplotlib.org/cmocean/) for the cmocean colormaps.

To use:
GMT has a simple command called "makecpt" that allows you to adjust the CPT scale to new minimum, maximum, and incremental values.
